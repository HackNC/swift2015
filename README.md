Starry
======

Companion app for the Introduction to iOS + Swift talk at HackNC 2015.

This is intended to demo some of Swift's basic functionality, and wasn't meant to demonstrate particularly _great_ usage of Cocoa/iOS APIs.

##Description

Allows users to act as hackathon judges, scoring hacks with a simple 5-star rating system. Hacks can be added, deleted (by swiping the table cell), and viewed.
